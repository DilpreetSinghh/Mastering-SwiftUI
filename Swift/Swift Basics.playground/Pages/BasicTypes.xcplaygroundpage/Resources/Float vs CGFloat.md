In Swift, `Double` and `CGFloat` are both floating-point numeric types, but they serve different purposes and come from different frameworks:

1. **Double**:
   - `Double` is a standard Swift type defined in the Swift Standard Library.
   - It is used to represent double-precision floating-point numbers.
   - `Double` conforms to the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, offering a high level of precision.
   - It's commonly used for general-purpose floating-point arithmetic, especially when high precision is required.
   - Example:
     ```swift
     let myDouble: Double = 3.14159
     ```

2. **CGFloat**:
   - `CGFloat` is a type alias defined in the Core Graphics framework (`CoreGraphics.CGFloat`).
   - It is used specifically for graphics-related calculations and drawing operations within Core Graphics.
   - The underlying type of `CGFloat` can vary depending on the platform: it's `Float` on 32-bit platforms and `Double` on 64-bit platforms.
   - It's used to ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary type conversions in graphics-related code.
   - Example:
     ```swift
     import CoreGraphics
     
     let myCGFloat: CGFloat = 3.14159
     ```

In summary, while both `Double` and `CGFloat` are floating-point types, `Double` is a general-purpose type with high precision, while `CGFloat` is specialized for graphics calculations and ensures consistency across different platforms in graphics-related code.
